# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition:
 My client, Nyan, is the owner of Hoffman and Company, a food-based delivery business operating in the local region. As his business expands, the current software is failing to manage key operational aspects efficiently, leading to bottlenecks in order processing, inventory tracking, and delivery coordination. These inefficiencies are negatively impacting customer satisfaction and business profitability. See the evidence of consultation in the appendix.

The specific challenges faced by the client include:
- Inefficient order processing: The current system does not effectively manage multiple restaurant locations, causing delays in customer orders.
- Inventory mismanagement: There is no automated system to track stock levels, resulting in frequent shortages or overstocking.
- Lack of role-based access: Employees and customers currently use the same interface, leading to security and operational inefficiencies.
- Inaccurate menu availability: Customers often place orders for unavailable items due to a lack of real-time menu updates.

To address these issues, the client requires a robust software solution that can streamline business operations, minimize human intervention in inventory control, and ensure smooth customer interactions.

## Proposed Solution
 A web-based platform will be developed to centralize business operations and provide structured management for orders, inventory, and staff roles. The solution will include:
- A multi-branch restaurant selection system.
- A real-time menu display with automatic updates on item availability.
- An inventory management system that triggers restocking when items run out.
- A login system differentiating between staff and customers, with role-specific functionalities.

Justification of Tools:

To develop this system, the programming language options considered were C and Python. C offers high performance but lacks built-in support for rapid web development and database integration. Python, on the other hand, supports web frameworks and database connectivity, making it a better choice for this application, where structured data handling and business logic implementation are key requirements. Due to these factors, Python was selected as the primary language.

The application will use KivyMD for the interface. While other options were considered, they are primarily suited for desktop applications and lack the responsiveness required for a web-based solution. KivyMD supports a structured UI approach while ensuring compatibility with the selected development stack.

For data management, a database is required to store persistent business data, including customer orders, menu availability, and inventory levels. Without a structured database, tracking transactions across sessions would be inefficient and unreliable. The options considered were MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Given that the application is for a small business with limited concurrent users, SQLite was chosen due to its lightweight nature and minimal setup requirements.

By addressing these specific business challenges, this software solution will improve operations, ensure seamless order processing, and allow for future scalability. 

#### See the evidence of consultation in the appendix for further details on client requirements.

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:
- The code will allow customers to browse restaurants and view menu availability dynamically.
- The code will provide users with a secure login system for both customers and staff.
- The code will be able to integrate with a local database using SQLite for data management.
- The program will allow staff to update menu items and stock levels in real-time.
- The program's login system will ensure secure password hashing to prevent unauthorized access.
